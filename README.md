# Symbolic Python

* spyder don't work for sympy  
* jupter or colab should be used.   
* Mathmatica, matlab is a good tool, but sympy is much simplier and easy to use  
* As a non-theory guy, sympy is enought to check algebra 
* We can just do symbolic math directly on live shell without python and colab.
